HORIZONTAL NEUTRAL WIND model
-----------------------------

The HWM is an empirical model of the horizontal neutral wind in the upper
thermosphere. It is based on wind data obtained from the AE-E and DE 2
satellites. A limited set of vector spherical harmonics is used to describe the
zonal and meridional wind components. The first edition of the model released 
in 1987 (HWM87) was intended for winds above 220 km. With the inclusion of
wind data from ground-based incoherent scatter radar and Fabry-Perot optical 
interferometers, HWM90 was extended down to 100 km and using MF/Meteor data 
HWM93 was extended down to the ground. Solar cycle variations are included
(since HWM90), but they are found to be small and not always very clearly
delineated be the current data. Variations with magnetic activity (Ap) are
included. Mid- and low-latitude data are reproduced quite well by the model. 
The polar vortices are present, but not to full detail. The model describes the
transition from predominately diurnal variations in the upper thermosphere to 
semidiurnal variations in the lower thermosphere and a transition from summer 
to winter flow  above 140 km to winter to summer flow below. Significant alti-
tude gradients in the wind extend up to 300 km at some local times. The model
software is provided as one file HWM93.TXT; earlier versions (HWM87, HWM90)
are also available from NSSDC on request. The software provides zonal and 
meridional winds for specified latitude, longitude, time, and Ap index.
