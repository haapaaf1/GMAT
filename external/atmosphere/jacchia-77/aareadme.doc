The Jacchia 1977 thermospheric model is combined with the U.S. Standard 
Atmosphere 1976 model. Temperature and component number densities are c
alculated from the ground to the maximum altitude requested. The only 
variable input parameter is the exospheric temperature. See the comments 
in the source code below for more details.
