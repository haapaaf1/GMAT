BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

The COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere (CIRA) provides empirical
models of atmospheric temperature and densities as recommended by the
Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Since the early sixties different
editions of CIRA have been published. The CIRA Working Group meets bi-
annual during the COSPAR General Assemblies. CIRA-86 is described in 
Advances in Space Research, Volume 8, Numbers 5-6, 1988; a more extensive 
report will be published as MAP Handbook. In the thermosphere (above 
about 100 km) CIRA-86 is identical with the MSIS model, which is also 
available from NSSDC (MI-91E). 

The lower part (0-120 km) of CIRA-86 consists of tables of the monthly 
mean values of temperature and zonal wind with almost global coverage 
(80N - 80S). Two sets of files were compiled, one in pressure coordinates 
including also the geopotential heights, and one in height coordinates 
including also the pressure values. These tables were generated from 
several global data compilations including ground-based and satellite 
(Nimbus 5,6,7) measurements: Oort (1983), Labitzke et al. (1985). The 
lower part was merged with MSIS-86 at 120 km altitude. In general, 
hydrostatic and thermal wind balance are maintained at all levels.
The model accurately reproduces most of the characteristic features of
the atmosphere such as the equatorial wind and the general structure 
of the tropopause, stratopause, and mesopause.

This data set is a corrected version of the orginal CIRA data files as
provided by J. Barnett (July 1990) in ASCII format.
