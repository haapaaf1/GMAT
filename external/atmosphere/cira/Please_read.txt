Subject: COSPAR 1986

Sir,

As per our telephone conversation on  22 November 1999 I am sending you this
e-mail in reference to the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere 1986, 0 -
120 km.  I was examining the pressures at the 60 km (200,000 ft., any month, at
30N latitude) when I noticed that they varied by approximately a factor of 10
from the US Standard Atmosphere, 1976 table at the same altitude.  In addition
at any month as your altitude increases the pressure varies irregular  It rises
and drops suddenly at specific altitudes.  If someone could please give me some
explanation to these issues I would greatly appreciate it.

Sincerely,

Subject: Found errors in CIRA ascii files ?
Cc: chandra@chapman.gsfc.nasa.gov, Anabelle.Menochet@tornado.badc.rl.ac.uk

Dear colleague,

while using the CIRA ascii files found at
http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/cira/data
[same as ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/atmospheric/cira/cira86ascii/]

I found what look very much like an error...

I was initially rather surprised, since I believed that the CIRA model was
now completely "debugged" after nearly 15 years of worldwide usage.

However, after cross checking my sources, I found that the error is
even present in the original publication :
        CIRA 1986, Part II Middle Atmosphere Models,
        D. Rees, J.J. Barnett, K. Labitzke (ed.),
        Advances in Space Research (COSPAR), Volume 10, Number 12, 1990.
on pages (12)400 - (12)401 and (12)454

the error on page (12)454 is benign : The last 5 lines from file shant.lsn

Height  (mb)  Height   80S   75S   70S   65S   60S   55S ...

 1.00  372.66   8.0    3.4   3.8   3.9   4.0   3.8   2.5 ...
 0.75  478.51   6.1    3.4   4.0   4.2   4.2   4.3   2.6 ...
 0.50  614.42   4.2    3.1   4.1   4.3   4.3   4.1   3.1 ...
 0.25  788.93   2.2    3.6   3.6   3.6   3.9   3.8   3.3 ...
 0.00  1013.0   0.1    3.6   3.6   3.6   1.3   1.7   2.0 ...

should read : (undefined values set to blank)

 1.00  372.66   8.0    3.4   3.8   3.9   4.0   3.8   2.5 ...
 0.75  478.51   6.1    3.4   4.0   4.2   4.2   4.3   2.6 ...

 0.25  788.93   2.2                      3.9   3.8   3.3 ...
 0.00  1013.0   0.1                      1.3   1.7   2.0 ...

However, the error on pages (12)400 - (12)401 is more serious !

If you consider the files nhz.lsn ans shz.lsn, and write down all
the lines corresponding to 0.00 Scale Height (last line each month),
it is obvious that the "ground" geopotential for OCTOBER is WRONG.
The "OCTOBER" line is obviously flawed with respect to other monthes.
        You can look a sample at the end of this message.
        A graphical representation is even more dramatic !

This error propagate also upward (in October only) and can still be
visually detected up to 1.25 scale height (6 lines of data).

It seems that one (or a few) wrong data were used in calculation
of geopotential height. I was not able to detect similar problems
on other files (temperature, wind, pressure). Nevertheless, it may
be judicious to check also the other data files.

        Thank you.              Best regards
                                Francis Dalaudier

  Dear Dieter,

I've found a non-consistency between your electronic version of CIRA-86
and the one contained in Rees, D., J.J. Barnett and K. Labitzke: CIRA:  
1986, Part II: Middle Atmosphere Models. As far as I could trace the
differences, they appear only in the height region 75 to 90 km. For
example, let's take a look at:
ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/atmospheric/cira/cira86ascii/twp.lsn
and page 430 of the book: At 80°S, twp.lsn says 200.7, 172.4, 145.7 and
139.1 for 75, 80, 85 and 90 km, respectively. The file, however, says
200.1, 171.7, 147.9 and 142.9. As I couldn't find any remark that the 
model has been updated since, I'd like to know whether the discrepancies 
are due to a mistake or due to some new data.

  Best regards,

    Rene'
