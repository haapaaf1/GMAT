Parameter: 		Neutral temperature and densities in the thermosphere

Brief Description:

The Marshall Engineering Thermosphere Model (MET) is essentially a modified
Jacchia 1970 model that includes some spatial and temporal variation patterns
of the Jacchia 1971 model. In addition to thermospheric densities and
temperatures the well-documented code provides also several often used
parameters like gravitational acceleration and specific heat. MET was
developed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville primarily for
engineering applications. The MSIS model is generally considered superior to
MET because of its larger data base and its more elaborate mathematical
formalism.
