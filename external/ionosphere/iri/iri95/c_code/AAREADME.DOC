--------------------------------------------------------

The IRI95 source in fortran has been translated to c using the f2cx.exe
program. The following changes were made to the original fortran
files so that the conversion could be performed:

1) The file IriF13.for has been modified according to the e-mail from
   Dr. Dieter Bilitza. The original file is named irif13.Ori
2) All files are renamed to .f for the conversion by f2cx.exe
3) The test program files are renamed to shorten the file names for 
   conversion by f2cx.exe as follows:
   iris13_test.f to iris13ts.f
   irit13_test.f to irit13ts.f
4) The test programs have also been modified so that they are 
   also converted by f2cx.exe. The modifications were as follows:
   a) Replace type* with write(*,*)
   b) Replace the variable AGNR with the value 6 in irit13_test.
5) Here is the for loop required to convert the output of the iris13_subroutine
   into the correct format. Fortran stores the arrays in column-major order
   while C stores them in row-major order. The conversion stores arrays into
   one-dimensional C arrays and issues appropriate sub-scripting expressions.
   We convert the format of the array here to a two dimensional array
   of outf[11][100] using local_outf[1100] as output from iris13_.

	   for (i = 0; i < 11; i++)

	     for (j = 0; j < 100; j++)
	     {
	       outf[i * 100 + j] = local_outf[i + j * 11];
	     } // for
	   } // for

When the conversion program f2cx.exe is run it must be run in
a directory off the root for best results.
The results of the conversion are the .c programs in this directory.

The conversion produces C++ code and prototypes using the batch 
file "Tranlsate.bat" to invoke f2cx.exe

To include the programs in an application you need the fortran conversion
library associated with the f2cx.exe program. These are provided

Please note that the ccir%%.asc, ursi%%.asc and ig_rz.dat files are
required to run the program. These files can be found in the 
directory fortran_code, which can be found at the same level as the
c_code directory (D. Bilitza, March 14, 2000)
