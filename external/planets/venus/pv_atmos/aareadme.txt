Pioneer Venus Thermospheric Model	1983

Author: A. E. Hedin, retired from NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771

Parameter: CO2, O, CO, N2, He, and N densities and exospheric temperature


Brief Description: 
The model describes the neutral densities and temperature in the Venus
thermosphere in the altitude range 140 km to 250 km. It is based on 
Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) data from the Orbiter Neutral Mass Spectrometer 
(ONMS) and on some density data from the entry probe. The model
formulation relies on modified Bates temperature profiles and the related
diffusive equilibrium density profiles. There are less than 15 coefficients 
per individual density model.
