[Fuel Tank]
VolumeHint=The original volume of the fuel in the tank
PressureModelHint=The pressure model for the fuel.\nPressure Regulated means that the pressure will be maintained as a constant during the duration of a thrust.\nBlow down means that the pressure in the tank will decrease with time as more fuel is released by a thruster.

[Formation]
AvailableSpacecraftListHint=Available spacecraft to add to formation
SelectedSpacecraftListHint=Spacecraft selected to be in the formation
AddSpacecraftHint=Add selected spacecraft to formation
RemoveSpacecraftHint=Remove selected spacecraft from formation
ClearSpacecraftHint=Remove all spacecraft to formation

[Parameter]
VariableNameHint=Variable Name (must follow labeling rules)
VariableValueHint=Value of the variable (real number or another variable name)
ArrayNameHint=Array Parameter Name (must follow labeling rules)
ArrayRowValueHint=Number of rows in the array (integer)
ArrayColumnValueHint=Number of columns in the array (integer)
StringNameHint=String Parameter Name (must follow labeling rules)
StringValueHint=Value of the string parameter
CreateVariableHint=Create (or replace) the variable
SelectHint=Select a parameter for the value of the variable
CreateArrayHint=Create (or replace) the array parameter with the specified dimension.  Replacing will lose all data in the array.
EditArrayHint=Edit the array

[Propagator]
IntegratorTypeHint=Select the Propagator's numerical integrator from the list of possible options
IntegratorInitialStepSizeHint=Size of the first step, in seconds, attempted by the numerical integrator
IntegratorAccuracyHint=GMAT compares the accuracy of each integration run as calculated using the Error Control model in the Force Model group box with the value here. If the accuracy is lower than that desired, an error is given and propagation stops.
IntegratorMinStepSizeHint=Smallest amount of time allotted as an integration step size (in seconds)
IntegratorMaxStepSizeHint=Largest amount of time allotted as an integration step size (in seconds)
IntegratorMaxStepAttemptsHint=How many times the numerical integrator will attempt to meet the Accuracy requirement you have set
IntegratorMinIntegrationErrorHint=Used by the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton integrator (and other predictor-corrector integrators when implemented) \nas the desired integration error to be obtained when the step size is changed.  \nPredictor-Corrector integrators adapt step size when the obtained integration error falls outside \nof the range of acceptable steps, as determined by the bounds set by the MinIntegrationerror and \nAccuracy fields. The integrator then applies an internal calculation to recompute the step size, \nattempting to hit the NomIntegrationerror, and restarts the integrator. 
IntegratorNominalIntegrationErrorHint=Used by the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton integrator (and other predictor-corrector integrators when implemented) \nas the desired integration error to be obtained when the step size is changed.  \nPredictor-Corrector integrators adapt step size when the obtained integration error falls outside \nof the range of acceptable steps, as determined by the bounds set by the MinIntegrationerror and \nAccuracy fields. The integrator then applies an internal calculation to recompute the step size, \nattempting to hit the NomIntegrationerror, and restarts the integrator. 
ForceModelErrorControlHint=The Error Control mode that GMAT uses to calculate how accurate its integration runs are for comparison to your defined value in the accuracy field
ForceModelCentralBodyHint=Select the central Celestial Body for the Propagator. Most of the time it will be the Primary Body
ForceModelPrimaryBodiesComboHint=Select a Primary Body to edit its parameters
ForceModelPrimaryBodiesEditHint=Add the primary bodies you desire using the associated Select button
ForceModelPrimaryBodiesSelectHint=Select a Primary Body to edit its parameters
ForceModelGravityModelHint=Choose which gravity model to use for the selected primary body
ForceModelGravityDegreeHint=Set the Degree of the Gravity Model
ForceModelGravityOrderHint=Set the Order of the Gravity Model
ForceModelGravitySearchHint=Select "Other" under the Gravity Model drop down menu to browse for the governing potential file
ForceModelGravityPotentialFileHint=Select "Other" under the Gravity Model drop down menu to set the governing potential file
ForceModelDragAtmosphereModelHint=Choose what Atmosphere Model GMAT should base its drag force calculations on

ForceModelPointMassesHint=Add Point Masses to the virtual solar system in which your spacecraft is in order to setup a 3 Body model. If a celestial object is a Primary Body, it may not be chosen as a Point Mass
ForceModelSelectPointMassesHint=Add or subtract Celestial Bodies from the list of Point Masses
ForceModelUseSolarRadiationPressureHint=Have GMAT account for Solar Radiation Pressure on the spacecraft
