The GMAT regression testing system is meant to automatically test the Acceptance and System tests using
a file difference comparison method between builds or a build and the good data. At the very least the 
truth data folder and scripts for testing will be CVS controlled.

Initially, users will have to have the latest scripts files built before runnning this program.

All scripts have to be unique to each test with the output have /*Test/ in the filename

Allow the user to add approved good data by file. Recording the approvers name to 
summary file selected for tracking.

Folder Structure:
========================
GMAT_RegSetup Folder 	- Main setup folder containing GMAT executable files, regression testing files, and 
	folders related to the aforementioned files. 
- *.dll 			- dll library files needed to run GMAT
- *.exe 			- There should only be one GMAT executable in this folder at the time of testing.
- GmatLog.txt		- 
- gmat_startup_file.txt	- Setup file needed to run GMAT

- files Folder		- Folder containing folders with planetary files, icons, etc

- matlab Folder		- Folder containing folder with matlab scripts
-- regressInput.txt	- Optional setup file for the regression testing system
-- comparisons Folder	- Folder containing matlab scripts needed for report comparisons

- input Folder		- Folder containing script folders for each type of test
-- AcceptTest Folder	- Folder containing all Acceptance Test scripts (MUST BE CVS controlled)
-- SystemTest Folder	- Folder containing all System Test scripts (MUST BE CVS controlled)

- output Folder		- Folder marked as default output for report files
-- AcceptTest Folder	- Folder containing all output for Acceptance Test reports
--- YYYYMMDD_reports	- Folders containing all Build Date specific output folders for Acceptance Test reports
--- Good_reports Folder	- Folder containing report files validated as good for testing 
    (MUST BE CVS controlled)

-- SystemTest Folder	- Folder containing all output for System Test reports
--- YYYYMMDD_reports	- Folders containing all Build Date specific output folders for System Test reports
--- Good_reports Folder	- Folder containing report files validated as good for testing 
    (MUST BE CVS controlled)

-- Comparisons Folder	- Folder containing all of the regression test summary files
-- YYYYMMDD_##_ABC.regrpt - Report files contianing the results of the regression testing system


Regression System Input:
========================
- The user will have have the choice of using a setup file or using the matlab command window for 
intial setup
- The user will have the option of building and running the scripts in the input folder themselves or 
having the program do it for them.
- The user will get to approve files as good after completing the regression test 
(Only one file can be approved at a time). Approvals will be logged into the selected regression 
test summary.

Regression System Output:
========================
- Comparison Summary
- Report files in a Build related folder

Regression System Current Problems:
======================== 
- If an error or crash occurs while Building and running a script in matlab GMAT doesn't continue unless 
the user hits the OK button.
- Approval process will be tedious if several files need to be approved.
