1) Checkout the entire GMAT_RegSetup repository
or
1) Update the entire GMAT_RegSetup repository
2) Place the GMAT .exe for testing into the main folder of the GMAT_RegSetup and
  remove any previous executables
3) Build & Run the AcceptTest and SystemTest script that you want to regression test, 
  using the new executable. They are located in the input/AcceptTest and 
  input/SystemTest folders.
4) Move the reports that were outputted to the main output/AcceptTest and 
  output/SystemTest folders to output/AcceptTest/YYYYMMDDGMAT_reports and
  output/SystemTest/YYYYMMDDGMAT_reports folders, respectively. YYYYMMDD is the Year
  Month and Day of the current Build Date that you are using.
5) Edit the matlab/comparisons/regressInput.txt file. Make sure to change UserIntials. 
  At the time these instructions were written, the following features are disabled:
	- Automatic Build & Run of the script files in the input/[Test type] folder
	- Automatic moving of the outputted report files to their YYYYMMDD folders
	- Build to Build comparisons (Only Build to Good data comparison are functional)
	- Comparing individual or specific tests (Can only compare all report files for 
	 all tests)
	- Running the GMAT regression system from the matlab command prompt (Can only be
	 run from the regressInput.txt setup file)
	- Approval process for modifying the *.good files
6) Open the matlab/comparisons/RegressionSystem.m in Matlab and run it. When prompted 
  change your current MAtlab directory to the one the file is in. The script will 
  automatically add any additional paths that it needs.
7) Follow the instruction on the screen, enter Y to load the setup from a file and 
  enjoy the results :).
8) Detail output is located in a *.regrpt file with the current date as part of the 
  file name.

IMPORTANT NOTES
- Do not CVS check-in the YYYYMMDDGMAT_reports folders created on your local machine.
- Do not CVS check-in the regressInput.txt setup file.
