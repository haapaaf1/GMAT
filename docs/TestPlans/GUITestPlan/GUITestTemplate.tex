\noindent\textbf{Panel Data Element Completeness and Correctness}\\

\noindent Description: This set of tests verifies that all data
elements that should appear on the panel indeed appear on the panel.
It also tests that all elements that should appear in show script
appear there and that items that should not appear in show script do
not appear there.

\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item Verify that only data elements that occur in the Range
    Test Plan appear in show script and that the user does not see
    any other object fields.   Also check that defaults agree with
    Range Test Plan.
    %
    \item Verify that all elements that should appear in show script
    appear.  (See range test plan)
    %
    \item  Verify that all data elements
    that appear in Show Script also appear on the GUI.  This
    means that if you can set something in the script, ensure that it
    appears in the GUI.
