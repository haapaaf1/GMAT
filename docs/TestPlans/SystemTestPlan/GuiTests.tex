\chapter{\label{chap:guitests}Executing Tests for the Graphical User Interface}

The tests described in this chapter are designed to exercise all of the controls and other elements
visible from the GMAT graphical user interface (GUI).  The GMAT GUI is designed to present a
consistent, easy to use interface into the underlying engine so that users of the system can view,
configure, and interact with the elements of the system during all phases of mission modeling.
System testers work with these elements, using them both to perform the expected tasks and to
attempt to perform undesired actions.  The former set of actions exercises the engine to ensure
that the system can be configured correctly.  The latter tests are run to ensure that users cannot
configure GMAT incorrectly.

\section{GUI Test Case Management}

The GUI test cases are managed using a test tracking spreadsheet generated at the end of test
preparation, described in Chapter~\ref{chap:testprep}.  Figure~\ref{figure:GuiTestTracker} shows an
example of this spreadsheet partway through a testing cycle.

The test procedure for GUI based tests requires extensive exercising of the components in the GUI.
Testers follow these steps when executing the system tests:

\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item:GetGuiTestcases} Obtain the latest versions of the GUI test cases and a local copy
of the test case tracking spreadsheet\footnote{The test tracking spreadsheet is generated from the
Systen Test Matrix spreadsheet using an OpenOffice macro, as described in
Section~\ref{section:CompleteCoverage}.}.
\item Identify the tests that the tester needs to run.
\item Open GMAT\footnote{GMAT should only be opened one time for any given testing period.  All
tests run during that test period -- typically a morning or afternoon -- should be run in the same
instance of GMAT.  This helps ensure that the system is stable over long periods of time.  If the
system is shut down, either by the user or through a system crash, that event should be noted.}.
\item Run each test following the procedure in Section~\ref{section:RunningGuiTests}.
\item As each test is run, record the results of the test on the test case worksheet retrieved in
step~\ref{item:GetGuiTestcases}.
\item When anomalies are found in testing, record them on the test case worksheet and enter them in
the bug tracking database.
\item Close GMAT at the end of the test period.
\item At the end of each day or when testing is finished, whichever occurs first, gather the
completed test case worksheets and place them in the folder used to gather the test results.
\item At the end of each day or when testing is finished, whichever occurs first, save the local
gui test tracking spreadsheet with the name <spreadsheetName>\_<tester's initials> in the folder
used to gather the test results.
\item Upon completion of all assigned test cases, report that status to the system test lead.
\end{enumerate}

The procedure for running a single test case is described next.

\section{\label{section:RunningGuiTests}Running the GUI System Tests}

By their very nature, the script based tests described in Chapter~\ref{chap:scripttests} follow a
linear execution sequence once the scripts have been written and debugged.  In contrast,
interactions performed using the GMAT GUI are less structured -- users can use the controls on the
GUI in a seemingly random fashion -- so the test cases for the GUI include allowances for
interacting with the GUI elements by the tester in a more free form manner than the script based
tests allow.

\subsection{Sample GUI Test Case}

A sample GUI test case is shown here:

\begin{quote}
\VerbatimInput[numbers=left,firstnumber=1]{./SystemTests/OpenGLPanel.txt}
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[300,235]{Images/OpenGLPanel.png}
\caption{\label{figure:openGLPanel}The OpenGLPlot Setup Panel}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent The test case worksheet shown here is the test case for the OpenGL plot setup panel.
The panel, shown in Figure~\ref{figure:openGLPanel}, is a fairly complex GUI panel,
containing text fields, combo boxes, check boxes, text lists, and action buttons which open color
selection dialogs.  Each element is included in the test plan worksheet, along with the standard
control processes that need to be exercised.  Each test criterion is evaluated using this worksheet,
and given a pass or fail evaluation.

\subsection{Procedure}

Each GUI test case has a worksheet like the one shown above.  A tester follows this procedure to
perform the associated system test:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the test case worksheet.
\item Follow the procedure outlined in the test case.
\begin{itemize}
\item Section~\ref{section:TestRules} provides detailed instructions about the process that should
be followed when testing each type of GUI element.
\item Each item identified in the worksheet is marked as either passing or failing the test.  If
the item fails, an associated bug is entered or identified in the bug tracking system and listed on
the worksheet.
\item After completing the tests on the worksheet, the tester experiments with the component for an
additional period (typically ten to fifteen minutes), checking to be sure that the component is
stable and behaves correctly when bad data is entered, and when random actions are taken using that
component.
\item Once every item on the worksheet has been evaluated and the final period of usability testing
has been performed, the number of pass and fail evaluations are counted and recorded in the
summary section of the test case worksheet. Any bugs identified on the worksheet are listed in this
section, and any additional notes that need to be recorded are also listed here\footnote{These data
are collected using an automation tool to build a status report for the system tests.}.
\end{itemize}
\item Summarize the results of the tests.
\begin{itemize}
\item Once every item on the worksheet has been evaluated, an overall pass or fail evaluation is
made and recorded in the summary section.  Any bugs identified on the worksheet are listed in this
section, and any additional notes that need to be recorded are also listed here.
\item Add the tester's name and the data the test was run to the worksheet.
\item Save the completed test case worksheet.
\end{itemize}
\item Update the local test tracking worksheet to indicate that the test was run and the results of
the run.
\item Save the test tracking worksheet.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reporting Results}

At the start of the system test process, a central location was established for collection of the
test results.  The final step performed by the system testers is to copy their test case worksheets
and local test tracking worksheet to this central location.  This action is performed each day the
system tests are run so that the progress of the system test execution can be evaluated.  Upon
completion of all system testing by a specific tester, a final update is made and the system test
lead is notified that that tester has completed the assigned tests.  Chapter~\ref{chap:reporting}
describes the consolidation of the collected test results into a system test report.

\section{\label{section:TestRules}Procedural Rules}

The steps described in the preceding sections lay out the procedures followed when testing the GUI
elements of GMAT.  In this section, the criteria that must be evaluated are defined for these
tests.

\subsection{Procedures for Specific Control Types}
The following table provides additional guidelines that should be followed when testing each
specific type of control.

\subsection{Usability Testing}

The tests described in the preceding paragraphs are meant to exercise all of the elements of the
graphical user interface.  One important aspect of the interface not covered by those tests is the
usability of the system: the GUI may perform error free as designed, and still be difficult to use
in practice.  Usability testing is performed to capture information about this aspect of the GUI.
