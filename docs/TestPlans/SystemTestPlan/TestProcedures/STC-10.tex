         This  case tests GUI behavior when attempting to convert to element representations when the
         cartesian state results in a circular, equatorial orbit.

         \begin{compactenum}
             \item Load BS-1.
             \item Open the dialog box for DefaultSC.
             \item Enter the following Cartesian State data:
                      \begin{compactenum}
                         \item X = 0.0
                         \item Y = 0.0
                         \item Z = 0.0
                         \item VX = 7.0;
                         \item VY = 7.0;
                         \item VZ = 7.0;
                      \end{compactenum}
             \item Hit Apply.
             \item Change the state to Keplerian and verify that the following error message is returned: The orbit is a singular conic section and the Keplerian elements are undefined.
             \item Change the state to Modified Keplerian and verify that the following error message is returned: The orbit is a singular conic section and the Modified Keplerian elements are undefined.
             \item Change the state to SphericalRADEC and verify that the following error message is returned: The orbit is a singular conic section and the SphericalRADEC elements are undefined.
             \item Change the state to SphericalAZEL and verify that the following error message is returned: The orbit is a singular conic section and the SphericalAZEL elements are undefined.
             \item Change the state to Equinoctial and verify that the following error message is returned:
                   The orbit is a singular conic section and the Equinoctial elements are undefined.
         \end{compactenum}
