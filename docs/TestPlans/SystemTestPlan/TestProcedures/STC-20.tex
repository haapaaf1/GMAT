         %====================== BEGIN: The test procedure
         \begin{compactenum}
             \item Load BS-1.
             \item Open the dialog box for DefaultSC.
             \item Change the state type to SphercialAZFPA
             \item Set the SphercialAZFPA state to the following values
                 \begin{compactenum}
                    \item RMAG  = 7000.00000
                    \item RA = 0
                    \item DEC = -0.04094487109516581
                    \item VMAG = 10.63431419820442
                    \item AZI = 0
                    \item FPA = 0.02061675296478873
                    \end{compactenum}
             \item Hit Apply.
             \item Change state type to Keplerian and ensure that the following error is thrown: ``Warning: A nearly singular conic section was encountered while converting from the SphercialAZFPA state to the Keplerian elements so conversion was aborted.  The radius of periapsis must be greater than 1 meter."
             \item Change state type to Modified Keplerian and ensure that the following error is thrown: ``Warning: A nearly singular conic section was encountered while converting from the SphercialAZFPA state to the Modified Keplerian elements so conversion was aborted.  The radius of periapsis must be greater than 1 meter."
             \item Change state type to Equinoctial and ensure that the following error is thrown:  ``Warning: A nearly singular conic section was encountered while converting from the SphercialAZFPA state to the Equinoctial elements so conversion was aborted.  The radius of periapsis must be greater than 1 meter."
                 \item Change RMAG to 0.00001 and click apply.
                 \item Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7.
                 \item Change RMAG to 70000.
                 \item Change VMAG to 1e-14.
                 \item Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7.
                 \item Change state type to SphericalRADEC and ensure that the following error is thrown: ``Warning: A nearly singular conic section was encountered while converting from the SphercialAZFPA state to the SphericalRADEC state so conversion was aborted.  The Right Ascension and Declination of velocity are undefined."
