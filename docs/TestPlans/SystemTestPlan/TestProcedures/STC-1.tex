         Summary &
         %----------------------  The Test Summary
         This test case appplies to state representation conversions performed by the Spacecraft Orbit dialog box.   The tests include conversions from Cartesian to all other state representations.\\
         \hline
         PreConditions & To run this test you need to load BS-1 and have data defined in TD-1 available.\\

         Steps &
         %------- The test data is here
         \begin{compactenum}
         \item Open the dialog box for DefaultSC via the GUI.
         \item Change the state type to Cartesian if it is not already set to Cartesian.
         \item Enter the cartesian state data defined in table TD-1.
         \item Hit the apply button.
         \item Change the state type drop down box to Keplerian and compare the Keplerian state to the
         Keplerian state data contained in TD-1. The states should be equivalent to 14 or 15 significant figures.
         \item   Change the State Type pull-down to ModifiedKeplerian and compare the new state data in the GUI to
         the Modified Keplerian Values in TD-1.  The states should be equivalent to 14 or 15 significant figures.
         \item   Change the State Type pull-down to SphericalAZFPA and compare the new state data in the GUI to the state for SphAZFPASat in TD-1.  The states should be equivalent to 14 or 15 significant figures.
        \item    Change the State Type pull-down to SphericalRADEC and compare the new state data in the GUI to the state for SphRADECSat in the TD-1.  The states should be equivalent to 14 or 15 significant figures.
        \item    Change the State Type pull-down to SphericalRADEC and compare the new state data in the GUI to the state for SphRADECSat in TD-1.  The states should be equivalent to 14 or 15 significant figures.
       \item     Change the State Type pull-down to Equinoctial and compare the new state data in the GUI, to the state for EquinocSat in TD-1.  The states should be equivalent to 14 or 15 significant figures.
