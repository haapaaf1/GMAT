         This  case tests GUI behavior when attempting to convert to element representations with 
         a cartesian state that results in a singular conic section.
         %======================  END: The Test Summary

         %====================== BEGIN: The test procedure
         \begin{compactenum}
             \item Load BS-1.
             \item Open the dialog box for DefaultSC.
             \item Enter the Cartesian state data from TD-5.
             \item Hit Apply.
             \item Change the State Type to Keplerian and verify the following error message is thrown:
             "GMAT does not support parabolic orbits in conversion from Cartesian to Keplerian state".
             \item Change the State Type to Modified Keplerian and verify the following error message is thrown:
             "GMAT does not support parabolic orbits in conversion from Cartesian to Keplerian state".
             \item Change the state to SphericalRADEC and verify the numeric data with TD-5.
             \item Change the state to SphericalAZEL and verify the numeric data with TD-5.
             \item Change the State Type to Equinoctial and verify the following error message is thrown:
             "GMAT does not support parabolic orbits in conversion from Cartesian to Equinoctial state".
         \end{compactenum}
         %====================== END: The test procedure
         \\ \hline
         Expected Results & The only State Types available are Cartesian, SphericalRADEC, and SphericalAZFPA.   State Types Keplerian, Modified Keplerian, and Equinoctial are NOT available because they are undefined.\\
