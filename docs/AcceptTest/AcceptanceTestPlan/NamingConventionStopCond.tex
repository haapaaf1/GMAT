This section describes the naming convention for stopping condition
scripts and output reports generated for use in GMAT's Acceptance
Test Plan. The naming convention consists of an ordered series of
option strings, separated by underscores (\_ ). Currently, options
are allowed for the following fields, and will be present in the
file name in order:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{tool} - The tool used to generate the test cases.
  \item \emph{Cb} - The Central Body used for the stopping
  condition, including the force model setup.
  \item \emph{stopCond} - The stopping condition used for the test
  case.
\end{enumerate}

The word StopCond precedes the \emph{tool} field. The final
stopping condition file format is as followed:\\
StopCond\_\emph{tool}\_\emph{Cb}\_\emph{stopCond}.report\\

The \emph{tool} field should always be the first option field.
Future additional fields should be added to the end of the list of
fields. Each field has a finite list of options, as follows (future
options should be added to this list):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{tool}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    STK  & - Satellite Toolkit HPOP or Astrogator\\
    FF   & - FreeFlyer\\
    GMAT & - General Mission Analysis Tool\\
  \end{tabular}

  \item \emph{Cb}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    EarthPM & - Earth central body with point mass force model\\
    EarthMJ2000EqPM & - Same as EarthPM and plane intersection calculations based on EarthMJ2000Eq\\
    EarthAll & - Earth central body with all force model types turned on\\
    EarthMJ2000EqAll & - Same as EarthAll and plane intersection calculations based on EarthMJ2000Eq\\
    Earth\#MultiSatsPM & - Same as EarthPM and the test case involves \# satellites \\
    MarsPM & - Mars central body with point mass force model\\
    MoonPM & - Moon central body with point mass force model\\
  \end{tabular}

  \item \emph{stopCond}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    A1ModJulian & - A1 Modified Julian Date\\
    Apoapsis & - Apoapsis of orbit based on TA\\
    Days & - Elapsed Days\\

    Periapsis  & - Periapsis of orbit based on TA\\
    Seconds  & - Elapsed Seconds\\
    TA\#\#\# & - \#\#\# degree True Anomaly\\
    XYplane & - XY Plane Intersection\\
    XZplane & - XZ Plane Intersection\\
    YZplane & - YZ Plane Intersection\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{enumerate}
