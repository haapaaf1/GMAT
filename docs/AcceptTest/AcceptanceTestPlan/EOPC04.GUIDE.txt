 				----------
	
   EOP(IERS) C 04 is regularly recomputed to take advantage on one hand of 
 the improvement of the various individual contributions and in the other hand 
 of the refinement of the analyses procedures. To date, it is twice-weekly 
 updated.
   
   In the course of the analyses the determination of the systematic corrections 
 of individual series entering the combination and the weighting procedure is 
 are currently re-examined.In addition,smoothing characteristics was changed to 
 carefully take into account the relative improvement of the individual series. 
  Table 1 shows the adopted smoothing characteristics over the successive 
 intervals. 
 
   The IERS C04 is given at one-day intervals, it is free from the diurnal/
  subdiurnal terms due to the oceanic effects and can be interpolated linearly. 
 The oscillations in UT and duration of the days due to zonal tides for periods
 under 35 days, as well as the 14d terms in dPsi, dEpsi are present in full 
 size in the series. Due to insufficient data over 1962-1984 dPsi and dEpsi 
 are based on a conventional model. Oceanic diurnal/sub-diurnal effects should
 be added back for users who require high accuracy information.

    EOP(IERS) C04 is slightly smoothed by Vondrak algorithm in order to 
 remove the high-frequency noise.

   The two tables below give :
      1 - The caracteristics of the smoothing adopted for each period (the 
          variations with periods shorter than the value in the table are
          smoothed out, except the short term variations in UT1 due to zonal
          tides and the 14d terms in celestial pole offsets, see above)
      2 - The uncertainty of one daily value of EOP for each period .
