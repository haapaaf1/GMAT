GMAT is a continually evolving software tool that will require
testing to be performed with each new iteration. Some new tests will
need to be added and some might need to be tweaked. The following
list presents a few areas that will need to be worked on in the
future:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Add GUI test cases}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Coordinate System Transformation}
        \item{Time System Transformation}
        \item{Duplication of select scripts}
        \item{Plot/Report checks}
        \item{Coordinate System, Libration Point, Barycenter, etc
        creation}
    \end{itemize}
    \item{Add attitude test cases}
    \item{Apply GMAT to past, present, and future missions to further improve its performance, usability, and visibility}
    \item{Continually submit bug reports to the software development
    team when problems arise during testing}
    \item{Update comparison script code and related scripts when necessary}
\end{itemize}
