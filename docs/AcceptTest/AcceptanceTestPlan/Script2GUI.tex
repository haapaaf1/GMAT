\chapter{Script-to-GUI template}

A select group of tests recreated in the GUI from a script mission
are created to help avoid situations where the script can perform
actions that the GUI can not. The results of these Script-to-GUI
tests are documented by a tester using the
Script2GUI\_GMAT\_template.doc.

Using the available template, a tester needs to go through each
panel of the GUI interface to duplicate the data seen in the script.
The tester needs to have a general understanding of how the GMAT
system works in order to get around some issues that may occur. The
tester records successful panel completions, as well as any bugs
generated. The template gives examples on how the data should be
entered.
