This section describes the naming convention for libration point
scripts and output reports generated for use in GMAT's Acceptance
Test Plan. The naming convention consists of an ordered series of
option strings, separated by underscores (\_ ). Currently, options
are allowed for the following fields, and will be present in the
file name in order:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{tool} - The tool used to generate the trajectory.
  \item \emph{libType} - The type of libration point used for the test
  case.
  \item \emph{libPoint} - The libration point used for the test
  case.
\end{enumerate}

The word LibrationTest precedes the \emph{tool} field. The final
stopping condition file format is as followed:\\
LibrationTest\_\emph{tool}\_\emph{libType}\_\emph{libPoint}.report\\

The \emph{tool} field should always be the first option field.
Future additional fields should be added to the end of the list of
fields. Each field has a finite list of options, as follows (future
options should be added to this list):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{tool}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    STK  & - Satellite Toolkit HPOP or Astrogator\\
    FF   & - FreeFlyer\\
    GMAT & - General Mission Analysis Tool\\
    OD   & - Orbital Determination Toolbox\\
  \end{tabular}

  \item \emph{libType}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    SEML & - Sun Earth Moon\\
    SEL  & - Sun Earth\\
  \end{tabular}

  \item \emph{libPoint}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \#   & - The libration Point number\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{enumerate}
