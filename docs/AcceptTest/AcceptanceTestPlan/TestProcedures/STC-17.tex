         %----------------------  The Test Summary
         This test case applies to state representation conversions performed by the Spacecraft Orbit dialog box. \\
         \hline
         PreConditions & To run this test you need to load BS-1 and have data defined in TD-1 available.\\

         Steps &
         %------- The test data is here
         \begin{compactenum}
         \item Open the dialog box for DefaultSC via the GUI.
         \item Change the state type to Modified Keplerian.
         \item Enter the Modified Keplerian data defined in table TD-1.
         \item Hit the apply button.
         \item Change the state type drop down box to Equinoctial and compare the state to the
         Equinoctial state data contained in TD-1. The states should be equivalent to 1significant figures.
