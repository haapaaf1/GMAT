# GMAT - General Mission Analysis Tool

Do you want to go to Mars but don't know when to leave or how much to bring?
Do you want to land something on the moon?  The General Mission Analysis Tool
(GMAT) is an open-source space mission analysis tool to answer just those
types of questions. GMAT is developed by a team of NASA, private industry,
public, and private contributors. GMAT is intended both for real-world
engineering design studies and as a tool for education and public engagement
in the spirit of the NASA Charter.

# Build On Linux

The official code does not have binaries or good documentation for building on
linux. I attempt to fix that in this fork.
