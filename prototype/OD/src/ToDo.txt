%  1)  User must be able to select/deselect from supported solve-fors and
%      consider parameters
%  2)  Users must be able to add/remove supported measurement objects
%  3)  Users must be able to add/remove supported data types
%  4)  Users must be able to add/remove supported dynamics models

%------ To do
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix measurement epochs in data files and corresponding code in estimator.  
Currently, it appears that measurement epochs are in elapsed seconds from
the previous measurement.  They need to be in some absolution epoch, probably
modified Julian date.

Fix Measurements to handle derivative map method.  Measurements need to 
return to the Ids of partials that are nonzero, given the estimator states.  
They also need to return the values of nonzero measurement partials when requested.

Fix hard coded kludge in RunEstimator that handles concatenation of Htilde matrix 
based on what estimator states are being included.

Write a measurement simulator by creating a new object or modifying the estimator.

Fix copy constructor and assignment method on Measurement to handle deep copy and assignment.
Currently, the copy constructor doesn't deep copy and the assignment command
only copies the Range Bias Value.
